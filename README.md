# Soft Computing
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Soft Computing. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. Character Recognition using Tensor Flow
2. Genetic Algorithm
3. Multi Perceptron Neural Network in MatLab
4. XOR Multi Perceptron Neural Network in MatLab
